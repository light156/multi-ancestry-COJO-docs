**Manc-COJO** is a tool for multi-ancestry conditional and joint analysis (COJO) of GWAS summary statistics. [TBD by Mark]

{: .highlight }
Note that our program can also perform single-ancestry COJO and reproduce the result of [original GCTA COJO], but runs much faster.

For example, for HDL trait on ~6.5 million SNPs and ~76,000 individuals, the running time per chromosome for our program using 1 thread, and GCTA using 5 threads, is as follows.
