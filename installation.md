# Installation

You can directly download the software here:

[Download link (64-bit Linux systems)](https://github.com/light156/multi-ancestry-COJO/releases/download/v1.0.0/manc_cojo){: .btn .btn-outline }

Or clone the repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/light156/multi-ancestry-COJO.git
cd multi-ancestry-COJO
```

If it doesn’t run immediately, make sure it has execution permission (**Linux** and **macOS** only):

```bash
chmod +x manc_cojo
```

You can confirm it runs correctly by checking its usage information, which prints the available options and a brief description of each.

```bash
./manc_cojo --help
```
